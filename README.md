# Smartphone-audio-cues-for-visually-impaired
Individuals with Visual Impairments have difficulty moving around in public areas. People tend to give way but inanimate objects cannot move out of the way.   Generally, assistive systems require specialised hardware and other information which makes these systems exclusive and harder to access for the general population.

Goal: To create a working system for visually impaired individuals that analyses video footage with a moving camera system and then provides the user with assistive stereo Audio Feedback to allow them to visualize the path or surroundings around them.

Note: Earphones would be preferable. However, any device with stereo speakers should also be able to tell the difference.
